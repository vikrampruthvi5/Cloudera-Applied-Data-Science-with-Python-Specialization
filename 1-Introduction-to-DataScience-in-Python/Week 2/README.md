# Week 2
## Christopher Brooks
In this week of the course you'll learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkits Python has for data cleaning and processing -- pandas. You'll learn how to read in data into DataFrame structures, how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed. The module ends with a programming assignment and a discussion question.

## Learning Objectives
* Create Series and DataFrame Data Structures
* Use pandas math functions, as well as broadcasting features
* Employ the pandas library to import and manipulate data
* Apply indexing and querying to DataFrames, and deal with missing values
